# Tendermint images repository

This repo consists of the dockerfiles / packer templates which build the images used in CI/CD pipelines and more.

Each image has an associated protected git branch. Images will only be built on commits to their respective branch.

Before writing any code in any of the branches, make sure to rebase on master first.
 
Thank you!
